# Theme Tools

Welcome to Theme Tools, a comprehensive monorepository managed by the Shopify Theme Code Tools team. This repository serves as a unified home for a collection of TypeScript packages that power the implementation of `theme-check`.

`theme-check` is a robust suite of checks and formatters designed to facilitate the crafting of well-built and performant Shopify themes. By enforcing high coding standards and best practices, it ensures the delivery of superior quality themes.

These tools are integral to numerous platforms such as `Shopify/cli` and `Shopify/online-store-web`, and are even utilized in the Visual Studio Code (VSCode) extension. The tools can be used individually or collectively, catering to varied use cases and offering flexibility in their application.

Importantly, Theme Tools aims to significantly enhance the quality of life for developers, particularly those engaged in advanced edits to Shopify online store themes. By providing a mix of command line and graphical user interface (GUI) tools, it supports a range of development workflows and environments.
