[Principle](./index.md): **Be opinionated, opened for debate, and configurable as a last resort**

There are a _lot_ of micro-decisions that goes into making a prettier plugin. We can't honestly hope to have discussions and consensus about _all_ of them. In order to cut through that, we start with an opinion and iterate on the areas that don't work.

Once the discussion is open, folks can argue about which is which and we end up with three possible resolutions:

- No changes
- Changed opinion
- Configuration

The configuration should always be the last option because it can exponentially increases the complexity of the plugin.
