# `@shopify/theme-language-server-browser`

This is the Browser wrapper of the runtime-agnostic [`@shopify/theme-language-server-common`](https://npm.im/@shopify/theme-language-server-common) package. It does not come with batteries included and assumes you know what you're doing.

Presumably for use in CodeMirror along with [`@shopify/codemirror-language-client`](https://npm.im/@shopify/codemirror-language-client).

See the [@shopify/theme-language-server-common README](../theme-language-server-common) for more details.
