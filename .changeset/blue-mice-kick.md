Add linked editing support for HTML element names

Just like for [HTML in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_52#_html), this feature is enabled by the `editor.linkedEditing` VS Code setting:

```json
"editor.linkedEditing": true
```


When enabled, this will make it so you can rename open/close pairs as you are typing.
